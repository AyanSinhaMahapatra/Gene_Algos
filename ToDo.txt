1. Check If Shaking From Results and then running VNS, we can get back to the result. 
2. Determine the Best Possible use of Top_Genetic_VNS and let it run for 4-5 ish cost results. (If that Actually Exists)
3. Gather as much Data possible from costs found. 
3. Implement the Inverse method and see how it works out. 
4. Check the Code by Suvomay Sir for Inspiration and Understand the Maths if Possible.
5. Check the entire code once. 
6. Implement Different Geneetic Algos/ Crossover Methods or other methods which directly effect the Schema system.
